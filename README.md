## Project Structure

### Smart Contracts

The core of the Blockchain PayPal DApp is the `Paypal` smart contract. It manages the creation, payment, and tracking of payment requests. Key functionalities include:
- **Name Registration**: Registering a userâ€™s name to their wallet address.
- **Payment Requests**: Creating payment requests specifying the amount and message.
- **Request Payment**: Paying a specific request with ETH.
- **Transaction History**: Viewing the transaction history of payments and requests.

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built using React.js and Next.js, with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. It interacts with the smart contract to handle user registration, payment requests, and transaction history.

### Key Components

1. **Add Name to Wallet**: Allows users to associate a name with their wallet address.
2. **Create Payment Request**: Users can create payment requests specifying the recipient, amount, and message.
3. **Pay Request**: Functionality to pay an existing payment request.
4. **View Requests and History**: Display current payment requests and transaction history.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mrmartin1998/blockchain-paypal.git
    cd blockchain-paypal
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start Ganache** (Personal Ethereum Blockchain):
    ```sh
    ganache-cli
    ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
    ```sh
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

6. **Open in Browser**:
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack decentralized application using modern technologies. It showcases my skills in smart contract development, blockchain integration, and building responsive web applications. Thank you for reviewing my project!
